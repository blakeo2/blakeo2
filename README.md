My name is Blake Ocampo and I'm currently a PhD candidate at the University Illinois at Urbana Champaign working under Professor Scott Denmark. I'm interested in chemoinformatics, data science, and applications of machine learning to chemistry, especially those related to process chemistry. I enjoy making tools for chemists that help enable their workflows in a more wholistic way. I have expeirence with RDKit, Openbabel, Openeye, and Keras/Pytorch, with my main coding language is Python. I'm looking to collaborate on encoding chemical properties and descriptor development.

The best way to reach me is blakeo2@illinois.edu
